Assignment 4 - Bo Henderson and Burde Prerana Kamath

Question 1:

Process Table:
If the information is stored in the process table, then the system will only have to push/pop the state information everytime the process changes. 
This will save time and memory. In addition to this, no stack pointer will be needed. Moreover, pointers are slower and could possibly lead to memoy leakage. Hence, the user of pointers can be avoided too.


Stack:
Stack can be used for pushing and popping in the Last in First Out way where the process that has been entered the last would be popped first.
It isn't useful for reversing the way the processes will be popped out. 
It can be very useful for navigating tree structures. 
Comes in handy for remembering a particular process state. If there is another process that modifies the state it can still revert to the previous state
Example: CPU registers, Implementing undo/redo behaviour.
